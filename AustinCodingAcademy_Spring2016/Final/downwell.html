                <p>Have you ever wondered what it’s like to plummet endlessly into a dark abyss wearing a bitchin’ pair of gun boots? Me neither, and now you never will thanks to Downwell!. The game places you in the shoes (errm… boots?) of what can most accurately be described as a curious young boy interested in risking his life by jumping down an open well. Along the way you’ll find plenty of badies begging to be stomped on and shot at, though the most interesting mechanic on display here is your gun boots. Other than surviving your way to bottom of the pit, the main purpose of Downwell is to build combos by crushing as many enemies in a row as possible without touching the ground as you make your descent. The boots themselves are limited by energy (ammo) while each different weapon you pick up along the way uses a different amount of this energy which can only be refilled by bouncing from one enemy to the next, or touching the ground. Sure the firepower can damage and kill creatures but are more or less used to keep you air-born and off the ground while you line up your next target to drop onto.</p>
                <p>On the topic of weapons, there are a number of them ranging from a powerful laser burst, to a shotgun, to a variety of rapid firearms each with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the starting machine gun pee shooter takes the least amount of energy to fire, keeping you in the air for longer but has a small damage output. On the other hand, the shotgun variety weapons pack a huge wallop for quickly taking out enemies that can’t be pounced, but have a huge energy expenditure making them less viable for building combos. It should be mentioned that the difficulty of Downwell builds quickly and by the time you make it to the second set of stages, you will be partaking in a bit of trial and error. By the end of the game the action is downright hectic and one wrong move can have you starting again from the top. The weapons are found in side caverns of the level as you make your way down and are presented as health items. For this reason it becomes necessary that you are comfortable with each weapon the game has to offer. It’s on you if you stick to your comfort weapons and forgo health when you most need it and no doubt make the game that much more difficult. What seems simple enough at first, you’ll soon realize the challenge of racking up huge combos takes a massive amount of skill and perseverance. Nonetheless, there is an interesting and addictive mechanic at play here. After time you’ll find yourself destroying 25 enemies in a row with ease, and man does it feel good when it all comes together!</p>
                <p>The paper that wraps the meat of the game is a wonderful retro game boy style reminiscent of the original Metroid with levels being procedurally generated each time you start anew. The bow on top are the plethora of unlocks and content that ensure you come back for more. Between levels you get a random selection of items that will help you in your descent. Things like a drone that add some extra firepower to your arsenal, the ability to stop time when damaged, or a health recharge. There is also a persistent rank system as you play that nets you different avatars that change some basic gameplay mechanics as well as overlays that change the way the game looks.</p>
                <p>All in all, the only real problem that I have with the game is not actually a fault of the game itself. I played it on my iPhone and we all know how finicky platforming touchscreen controls can be. Even when I was at my most comfortable with the controls, I still found myself missing “button presses” causing me to get damaged or misalign a stomp. This shouldn’t keep you from playing this game in whatever fashion you can though. The sometimes frustrating touchscreen controls are just that, occasionally problematic but at times, can be glaring due to the relatively high difficulty level. Even more so, the game is available through steam and I’d imagine a good controller would resolve any issue one would have playing on a touch screen device.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, not much negative that can be said about Downwell. It’s simple yet inventive arcade action gives you plenty of reasons to continue jumping down that hole over and over. The levels are short enough that you can run through a couple when you have a spare moment, yet it’s completely possible to spend a few hours attempting to master the complex simplicity of it all. With the upgrades and addictive high octane gameplay solidly locked into my brain, I can easily say that this is a nearly perfect little game that anyone remotely interested in 2D action should check out. </p>
