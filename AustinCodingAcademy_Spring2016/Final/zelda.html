                <p>It’s no secret that The Legend of Zelda series is one of the most beloved of all time. Ask anyone what their favorite game is and there’s a good chance that they will come back at you with Ocarina of Time. From the very beginning, the series has been a monolith of innovation and wonder. Nintendo has poured countless hours into the series over 25 years to ensure that each incarnation lives up to the standards that their fans and they themselves demand. It’s no surprise though that after almost 30 years though, the more recent titles have been somewhat criticized for their lack of innovation which tends to be a staple of the series. While A Link Between Worlds doesn’t do much to break the usual Zelda mold, it does a few thing differently that breathe new life into a rather retro experience.</p>

                <p>Before I get into the new stuff, I should go over the old stuff first because there’s a lot of it here. A Link Between Worlds is a love letter to fans of the classic 2D games of the series. The overworld is almost entirely ripped from A Link to the Past. All the classic stuff you’ve come to expect is here. The light world (Hyrule) and Dark World (Lorule), collecting three sacred items in the former, saving seven sages in the latter, themed dungeons, the Master Sword… it’s all here. Even a majority of the music and sound samples are reused to great effect. The soundtrack is masterfully rerecorded and remixed from its former 16-bit glory adding in booming symbols and horns to the Light World theme, and sassy Spanish guitar rhythms to the Dark World theme. Everything has been treated with love and care here, and it can’t be overstated how glorious it is seeing all of the characters and enemies from A Link to the Past redesigned to fit a 3D world even if they appear a bit goofy at times. As a side note, speaking of 3D worlds. The 3D effects on show here are fantastic and are certainly used in many creative ways. ALBW is a rare example of how the capabilities of the 3DS can be utilized for more than just style and without a doubt, you should be maxing out that slider as often as you can.</p>

                <p>Now to mix things up a bit. No longer are you finding weapons in dungeons, relying instead on a rental system that allows you to pay a small fee to use just about any weapon in the game from the get go. Weapons can also be purchased a short way into the game for a much higher fee and can else ware be upgraded by collecting maiamai (this games version of Golden Skulltulas) and returning them to their mother. The ability to outright obtain weapons for keeps is a nice addition zince every death sees your rented weapons taken away only to be re-rented. Weapon use is also completely governed by a regenerating stamina meter this time around. Every arrow you shoot, bomb you drop, hammer you swing, and fire pillar you conjure eats into your stamina bar. There is no ammo management whatsoever. At first I saw this as a negative but seeing as how in most other entries I always seem to be at full capacity, the change seems rather inconsequential. This new approach creates a much more open and player driven Hyrule than previous entries in the series. The pre-Master Sword segments of the game are a bit more directed but once you reach Lorule, the game blows wide open allowing you to explore the world, find secrets, and complete dungeons in just about any order you please.</p>

                <p>Of course, any Zelda game wouldn’t be complete without a gameplay centered mechanic. Ocarina of time had the Ocarina, Wind Waker had a boat and the open ocean, and in Twilight Princess you could… become a wolf? In a Link Between Worlds you can merge with any vertical surface and become a horizontally moving painting. This feature is utilized in just about all of the game’s exploration and puzzle solving. It’s a device that really forces you to think outside of the box and outside of the normal problem solving required in most other games. It a truly creative element that’s so basic it’s hard to imagine that it’s never been utilized before, and what a better series to showcase such innovation.</p>

                <p>Seeing as this is a portable game, the dungeons here are a bit more streamlined than before and can be completed in less than 30 minutes in most cases. Actually, dominated might be a better word to explain how quickly you can run through these things. Very rarely was I ever stumped by one of the puzzles and when I did solve them it was less of a “eureka” moment and more of a “duh you idiot maybe you should pay better attention” moment. I stumbled upon more “aha” moments in the overworld inadvertently discovering secrets than in any of the dungeons. The same goes for the bosses who’s patterns can be figured out easily apart from the last boss whom I died against 2 times, mind you I died a total of 3 times over the course of the game. The redeeming factor here is the shine and sheen of these dungeons and bosses. At no time was I frustrated or bored as I was making my way through the game and that’s certainly a testament to the polish on display here. The design of the dungeons is realized and fully entertaining to traverse. It’s simply a fun game to experience and enjoy.</p>

                <p>To round things out are a handful of side objectives and mini-games if you wish to spend as much time with the game as possible. The typical heart piece hunt is here. You can temper the Master Sword a number of times, collect all the previously mentioned maiamais to upgrade your items, smack some balls homerun derby style, and scour a few different rupee ridden mini dungeons for some extra spending money. There’s even some street pass stuff going on here where you can pit yourself against shadow versions of other players link avatars in duels. All in all, there’s plenty to be done if you find the need to fully acquaint yourself with A Link Between Worlds. I hardly did any of these things however because I felt the meat of the game was more than enough to keep me occupied for the hours I invested but the inclusion is respectable.</p>

                <p>A Link Between Worlds has been described as a game changing entry to the series but I don’t necessarily see it that way. There's plenty of the same stuff you’ve gotten used to going on here, but the freedom they’ve added by way of the new weapon rental system and merge mechanic has created a refreshing take on the series that we haven’t really seen since the original Legend of Zelda back in 1986. With some major changes seemingly on the horizon from the latest Zelda title yet to be released, A Link Between Worlds not only stands as a massively enjoyable game, but proof that Nintendo has yet to let up on one of the most beloved franchises of all time. The old adage; only time will tell if the Wii-U incarnation of Zelda will come out a triumph or disaster, but A Link Between Worlds is proof that Nintendo hasn’t run out of ideas for the series, and I honestly can’t see that changing any time soon.</p>
